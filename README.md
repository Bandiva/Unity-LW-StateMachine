# Unity-LW-StateMachine
I made this because I hated how bloated other state machines are, this is so easy to understand using interfaces. In fact it is so light weight the base of it is only made with 2 files. But its so easy to implement new state machines and bases. An experimental working visual node viewer is also apart of the project, but it optional.
