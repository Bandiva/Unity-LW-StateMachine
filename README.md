# Unity-LW-StateMachine
I made this because I hated how bloated other state machines are, this is so easy to understand using interfaces. In fact it is so light weight the base of it is only made with 2 files. But its so easy to implement new state machines and bases. An experimental working visual node viewer is also apart of the project, but it optional.

## Quick Start
- Import files and folders (if folders already exist then place files in those folders)
- Make a inhereted state machine using the templates, connect them
- Thats.. it.
